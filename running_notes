Q - Are committees chosen robust under closure randomness?

What are the clustering patterns under greedy selection verses random selection?


Plot diameter under convergence

>found though error in random convergence calulcator - should use best committee as measurement of coverage quality possible, not randomly chosen committee


>greedy method may quickly convergence over few instances but lack foresight

?think through
